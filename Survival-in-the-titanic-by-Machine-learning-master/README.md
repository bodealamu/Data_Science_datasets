# Survival-in-the-titanic-by-Machine-learning
Analysis of the Titanic dataset.
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most tragic maritime accidents of all time, it sank on the 15th of April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean leaving 1500 people out of it 2224 passengers dead.

The Titanic was on its maiden voyage from Southampton to Newyork with stops at Cherbourg and Queenstown to pick up more passengers.

This project is concerned with exploring the data available for the passengers and applying machine learning algorithms to predict if a particular passenger would survive or not.

The data was gotten from Kaggle here
